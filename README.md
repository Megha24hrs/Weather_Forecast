This code is a simple weather forecast application using Tkinter and the OpenWeatherMap API to display weather information for a selected city. Here's an overview of your code:

Import necessary libraries, including Tkinter, ttk, and requests.

Define a function data_get() that fetches weather data for the city selected by the user from the OpenWeatherMap API. The API key is included in the URL.

Create the main application window (win) with a title, background color, and geometry settings.

Add a label for the application title.

Define a variable city_name to store the selected city name and create a combobox (com) for users to select a city from a predefined list.

Create a button (click_button) that, when clicked, calls the data_get() function to fetch and display weather data.

Add labels to display weather information:

Weather Climate (w_label, w_label1)
Description (wb_label, wb_label1)
Temperature (temp_label, temp_label1)
Pressure (per_label, per_label1)
Initialize the Tkinter main event loop using win.mainloop().

The code allows users to select a city from a dropdown list, click a button to fetch weather data from the API, and display the weather climate, description, temperature, and pressure on the GUI.
